    The FINDOBJ method of the HANDLE class follows the same syntax as the 
    MATLAB FINDOBJ command, except that the first argument must be an array
    of handles to objects.
 
    HM = FINDOBJ(H, <conditions>) searches the handle object array H and 
    returns an array of handle objects matching the specified conditions.
    Only the public members of the objects of H are considered when 
    evaluating the conditions.
